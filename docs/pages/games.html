			<b>Trails of Arkenstone</b>
			<br />
			A turn based strategy game that's a cross between Scotland-Yard (the board game) and The Lord of the Rings Universe,
			where the player has to guide a she-elf carrying the 'Arkenstone' from the city of Gondor to Erebor, while Sauron's Orcs try to catch her!

				More information:<br>
				The player guides the elf from one location to another over a huge map of Middle Earth.
				Orcs start at different locations on the same map and know the player's initial location.<br>
				Players can select any of these three modes of transport where each mode has a cost associated with it.
				<ul>
					<li>Road  - Cheapest but can only cover short distances.</li>
					<li>Cart  - Covers medium distances but costs more than roads.</li>
					<li>Eagle - Can travel massive distances, but very expensive to take.</li>
				</ul>
				
				As soon as the player decides a mode of transport and selects the next location on the map, the Orcs know what mode of transport was taken by the elf.
				(Sauron does have spies everywhere on Middle Earth)<br><br>
				Since each location on the map could be connected to several others with the same mode of transport, it's not easy to know with certainty where the player has landed.
				After a couple of hops, this set of possible locations grows non-linearly. 
				This is where the AI comes in.<br><br>
				
				If any Orc lands on the location where the elf is, its game over for the elf and the player loses.<br>
				If the player manages to lead the elf to Erebor without getting caught or losing all her money, the player wins!

				AI used:<br>
				The Orcs use what I call <b>"Orc Intelligence"</b> which is the crux of the AI.<br>
				Orc Intelligence predicts the current location of the player based on information about the kind of travel the player has taken so far.
				This is a <b>probability based search heuristic</b> algorithm that I developed for this game.<br><br>
				
				Each Orc has an individual personality-AI that "decides" what to do with the predicted player's location.
				This makes all Orcs unique in their own way to tracking and capturing the player.<br>
				A certain degree of randomness was introduced after play testing to ensure that players can't identify patterns in the AI's behavior.

				Remember the monsters that hid under your bed? This is a game where these monsters are real and are constantly hunting you down!

				More information:<br>
				This is a first person survival horror game where Stealth is the only weapon (Other than the massive shiny axe the player gets towards the end).
				You can hear a monster walk and even breathe if you listen carefully.<br>
				The player has to observe the monster's movements and learn it's patterns in order to sneak around it.<br><br>
				
				Each level has tasks that need to be accomplished in order to complete the level and move to the next. A task can be as simple
				as going from one location to another, or as complicated as collecting several parts of a magical device to fix it.<br>
				Later in a level, the player gets an axe that she uses to hunt monsters.
				At this point, the objective of the game is reversed where the hunter now becomes the hunted.<br>

			<div id="survive-ai" class="collapse jumbotron text-left" style="padding: 20px !important; line-height: 1.4 !important;">
				AI used:<br>
				The monster's movement and behavior is represented by a Finite State Machine.
				But this behavior is controlled by a <b>hunt-escape</b> algorithm that I developed to make the monster seem more monster-like.<br>
				While on the move, a monster can "sense" the player's presence based on the hunt-escape algorithm.<br><br>
				
				Assisting the monster, is a zombie. On sensing the player, a zombie shouts loudly attracting close-by monsters to them.
				Zombie behavior is represented using its own FSM but uses the same sense engine.

			<b>Shoot em Up!</b>

				We used strategy, we used stealth.. Now it's time for some wild shooting mahem!
				If shooting grunts and trolls with a variety of guns and watching them die is your thing.. You'll love this game!

				More information:<br>
				Killed by a couple of shots, the strength of grunts lies in their numbers.
				Trolls are slow, but extremely strong. I've seen players empty their entire ammo on a troll, barely hurting it.<br><br>
				
				In this universe, it's every man, grunt or troll for himself.
				Grunts act in unison, working together to swarm the player and the troll with equal vigor. Trolls have their own thing going on.<br>
				Only if the player gets hostile towards a troll, does the troll ever attack the player.
				But that does not make the troll your friend. The objective of each level is to survive till a gate is unlocked.
				Once done, it's a race between the player and the troll. Whoever enters the gate first, wins.<br>
				This creates an interesting dynamic where a smart player would first let the troll assist in killing the grunts and later want to kill the troll
				in order to finish the level.<br><br>
				
				The underlying idea is to show that creatures (or people) that look different than you or scarier than you need not be your enemy.

				AI used:<br>
				The AI in focus for this game was for the troll. It incorporates the tit-for-tat strategy to decide whether or not to attack the player.
				It goes one step further than your usual "if attacked then attack" strategy and incorporates forgiveness.
				This is in essence a variation of <b>Tit for Double-Tat</b> strategy  used in what I call <b>intension engine</b><br>
				The algorithm measures the player's intention by analyzing the payer's choice of target for every shot fired (or not fired).
				This drives the troll's behavior.<br><br>
				
				The troll and the grunt both have their own FSM that represent their behavior, be it resting, hunting a player, attacking or dying.<br>
