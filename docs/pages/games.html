			<b>Trails of Arkenstone</b>
			<br />
			A turn based strategy game that's a cross between Scotland-Yard (the board game) and The Lord of the Rings Universe,
			where the player has to guide a she-elf carrying the 'Arkenstone' from the city of Gondor to Erebor and hide it there while Sauron's Orcs try and catch her!

				More information:<br>
				The player guides the elf from one location to another over a huge map of Middle Earth.
				The Orcs start at different locations on the same map and know the player's initial location.<br>
				The player can select any of the three modes of transport where each mode has a cost associated to taking it.
				<ul>
					<li>Road  - Cheapest but can only cover short distances.</li>
					<li>Cart  - Covers medium distances but costs more than roads.</li>
					<li>Eagle - Can travel massive distances, but very expensive to take.</li>
				</ul>

				As soon as the player decides where to lead the elf, the Orcs know what mode of transport was taken by the elf.
				Sauron does have spies everywhere on Middle Earth.<br>
				Since each location on the map is could be connected to several others with the same mode of transport, it's not easy to know with certainty where the player has landed.
				After a couple of hops, it can get all the more complicated to know exactly where the player is.<br>
				This is where the AI comes in.<br><br>
				
				If any Orc lands on the location where the elf is, its game over for the elf and the player loses.<br>
				If the player manages to lead the elf to Erebor without getting caught or losing all her money, the player wins!

				AI used:<br>
				The Orcs use what I call "Orc Intelligence" which is the crux of the AI.<br>
				Orc Intelligence predicts the current location of the player based on information about the kind of travel the player has taken so far.
				This is a <b>probability based search heuristic</b> algorithm that I developed for thus game.<br><br>
				
				Each Orc has an individual personality-AI that 'decides' what to do with the predicted player's location.
				This makes all Orcs unique in their own way to tracking and capturing the player.<br>
				A certain degree of randomness was introduced after play testing to ensure that players can't identify patterns in the AI's behaviour.

			<b>Survive</b>
			<br />
				Remember the monsters that hid under your bed? This is a game where these monsters are real and are constantly hunting you down!<br>
				A survival-horror game where you use stealth and observations to sneak behind monsters to accomplish certain tasks in order to complete a level.

				More information:<br>
				This is a first person survival horror game where Stealth is the only weapon (Other than the massive shiny axe the player gets towards the end).
				You can hear a monster walk and even breathe if you listen carefully.<br>
				The mosnter moves on a predefined path in a locality, constantly looking for the player.
				On seeing the player, the monster rushes towards her.
				If the player manages to get out of the monster's line of sight,
				the monster searches in the nearby location for a short period before giving up and returning to his patrol.<br><br>
				
				It soudns pretty easy right..?<br>
				Now imagine playing this game where light is scarse. In a weird lightless world you only have a flashlight you can use to look around.
				The monster on the other hand, doesn't need a flashlight to see you! Well, he is a monster, he's bound to have abilities like these..<br>
				Your flashlight relies on batteries that run out over time. If that happenes, you're in a mess!<br>
				Flashlights are placed around the map but are scarse, forcing the player to incorporate resource management.<br>
				Each level has tasks that need to be accomplished in order to complete the level and move to the next. A task can be as simple
				as going from one location to another, while another can be as complicated as collecting several parts of a magical device to fix it.
				All of which demand a stealthy approach.<br><br>
				Later in a level, the player gets an axe that she uses to hunt the monster!
				During this stage, the monster flees on seeing the player. At this point, the objective of the game is reversed where the hunter now becomes the hunted.<br>
				The player must still use a certain level of stealth in order to get close enough to the monster in order to kill it.

			<div id="survive-ai" class="collapse jumbotron text-left" style="padding: 20px !important; line-height: 1.4 !important;">
				AI used:<br>
				The primary AI used is a <b>hunt-escape</b> algorithm that the monsters encorporate. The monsters have a predefined path that they follow.
				During this, they can sense the player's presence. Player sensing is based on the following parameters:
				<ul>
					<li>Is the player in the monster's line of sight?</li>
					<li>How far away is the player?</li>
					<li>Is the player's flashlight on?</li>
					<li>is the player noisy?</li>
				</ul>
				Once the monster 'senses' the player, it starts following her. When the player is no longer 'sensed' by the monster, the monster 
				heads to a random location in the nearby area, increasing the chance to finding the player once again.
				This is implemented using a Finite State Machine that defines the monster's state.<br><br>
				later in the game, the mosnter runs away from the player on 'sensing' the player. This is implemented easily by adding a nother state in
				the monster's FSM.<br><br>
				Another addition to the AI is a zombie.
				I mean, we have monsters in a weird world with creepy sounds and the player picking up magical orbs.. Is including a zombie really that off-track..?<br>
				The zombie, unlike the monster, only roams around in the map. On 'sensing' the player, informs the nearby monsters to the player's location.
				Zombies are implemented using their own FSM assisting the monsters.

			<b>Shoot em Up!</b>
			<br />
				We used strategy, we used stealth.. Now it's time for some shooting fun! That's what this new game is about.<br>
				Equipped with a multi-purpose gun and a variety of ammo, aim and shoot your way through waves of grunts and trolls in several maps.

			<div id="shoot-plus" class="collapse jumbotron text-left" style="padding: 20px !important; line-height: 1.4 !important;">
				More information:<br>
				You start the game with a gun that shoots simple bullets. Grunts spawn at random locations around the player. A few well aimed shots kill a grunt.<br>
				Grunts can see the player and on seeing one, run towards the player swinging their mace.If they get close enough, can attack the player.
				Their strength lies in their numbers.<br>
				The player has to be agile and move around the map gathering ammo in order to dodge these grunts and manage to kill them.<br><br>
				
				Then there are the trolls. These are slow. Very slow but extremely strong. I've seen players empty their entire ammo on a troll, only to half it's health.
				One hit by a troll can damage all characters around a certain radius (both players and the grunts).<br><br>
				
				Now for the interesting part: These characters - The grunts and the trolls, are not really friends.
				In this universe, it's every man, grunt, troll for himself.
				Grunts act in unision, working together to attack the player and the trolls equally. Trolls have their own thing going on.
				They attack the grunts but not the player!<br>
				This aspect is not really made clear. Only if the player gets hostole towards a troll, does the troll ever attack the player.<br>
				But that does not make the troll your friend. The objective of each level is to survive till a gate is unlocked.
				Once the gate is unlocked, it's a race between the player and the troll. Whoever enters the gate first, wins.<br>
				This creates an interesting dynamic where a smart player would first let the troll assist in killing the grunts and later want to kill the troll
				in order to finish the level.<br><br>
				
				The underlying idea is to show that creatures (or people) that look different than you or scarier than you need not always be your enemy.

				AI used:<br>
				The AI in focus for this game was for the troll. It incorporates the tit-for-tat strategy to decide weather or not to attack the player.
				It goes one step further than your usual 'if-attacked: attack' strategy and incorporates forgiveness.
				This is in essense a variation of Tit for Double-Tat strtagey used in what I call <b>intension engine</b><br>
				The algorithm measures the player's intention by analyzing the payer's choice of target for evry shot fired (or not fired).
				This drives the troll's behaviour.<br><br>
				
				The troll and the grunt both have their own FSM engines that dictate their motion, be it resting, hunting a player, attacking or dying.<br>
				There are three ammo types that the player can use against the NPCs.
				Once the player picks an ammo, he loses the older one. He cannot carry more than one weapon at any given time forcing him to strategize keeping in mind
				the location of the ammo that he needs.<br>
