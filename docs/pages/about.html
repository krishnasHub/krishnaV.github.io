			<p>On the first glance, I'm just a software developer..</p>
			<p>
				Worked with <b>Accenture</b> for 5 years on open source technologies like Mule ESB and Java Spring AOP building ...
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I turned towards .NET<br />
				This happened when I got into a startup with a friend of my friend. We developed ...
			</p>
			<p>
				Then it was back to Java. Applying what I learnt on web technologies to the open source world of Java, I worked on ...
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This journey was an amazing learning experience. I learnt new technologies, made marvelous applications and truly understood the importance of engineering good software as compared to writing code that somehow works.<br/>
				But deep down, something felt incomplete. I knew there was more I could explore in the world of programming where my creativity and my imagination can come ahead and work together with my technical knowledge to 
				create something that's both fun and a challenge to use.<br/>
				The answer was obvious - <b>Games</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The very first game I worked on was a simple Pool game with almost no AI except the one that guides the way the pool balls bounce when they crash into each other or the boundaries.<br/>
				Implementing that was fun and watchign it come to life was even more satisfying.<br/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Then I started working on something more complicated. A Tic Tac Toe game was one something I was proud of for a very long time.<br/>
				It had a a properly working Minmax algorithm that would fetch the right move for the given board configuration.<br/>
				But then I wanted something more.. umm.. fun!<br/>
				I then started working on a 3D Tic Tac Toe game.<br/>
				Think of it as three Tic Tac Toe game boards placed one on top of each other. The player can make a move on any of the three planes. Any winning move on one plane wins the game.
				Also, a player can make a move that crosses these three planes. eg. the top left corner of all three boards together can win the game. The top left corner of the top most board,
				the middle block of the second board and the bottom right block of the 3rd board together forms a winning game!<br/>
				With this, the traditional game having 8 winnng possibilities is now 54!<br/>
				Designing the AI for this was not so far fetched as the previous AI. It was merely adding another dimension. but it wasn't such an easy task.<br />
				and speaking of challenges, I had the itch to run this game on my PSP.<br/>
				So I found a way to programme my PSP (using a psp mod tool that lets me package my custom code to run on a PSP firmware) and finally ran my game on my PSP!<br />
				Before I could have my Eureka movement, the app blew up in my face. Although the algorithm worked correctly, the PSP's memory wasn't sufficient to support running the algorithm.<br/>
				I hit the drawing board again. This time, I added another heuristic to the algorithm. my custom tree pruning algorithm worked based on the favorability of each associated block on all boards.<br />
				the central board's central block had the highest weight while the top and bottom board's side blocks had the least.<br/>
				This value was deduced based on the number of times a block can simply be used to form a winning set.<br/>
				This new heuristic was a game changer. My code ran successfully on my PSP and it turned out to be one of my favorate creations so far!<br/>
				Later I added a 3D model of the boards for better visualization using OpenGL so my game looked at least half as smart as it plays.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This experience brought out my passion for making computer games. Not only do I play them, I also enjoy building them!<br/>
				Now, there was no turning back. I have to tumble down this rabbit hole to see what this wonderland holds for me.
