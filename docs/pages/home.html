				A passionate software developer by day, a true gamer by night.. I spend my time challenging myself,
				be it hunting down Martyr Logarius on the rooftops of Cainhurst or building customizable UI elements that correspond to a variety of data types in a true dynamic sense.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I've worked on a few fun projects along the way.
				Some that blew up in my face, that can only be labeled "horribly inefficient". Some that are still running in the real world, serving over a billion clients per hour,
				some that are still considered benchmark applications and some prototypes that were built, tested and approved, but never put to production.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Now, perusing my Masters in Computer Science from Northeastern University, I'm out on a new adventure.
				New technologies to learn, new challenges to beat and all so many systems to develop!			
			</p>
			<p>
				They say a journey of a thousand steps starts with one.
				This is me taking my first step and I'm sure my journey, wherever it leads me, would be a fruitful experience.
