        <h2>Welcome</h2>

        <p>This is me leaving my mark on the internet. My very own cozy web space to talk about me and what I've been up to!</p>

			<p>
				I'm a passionate software developer with an inclination to create something intuitive and useful that just makes sense.
				I've been working since I've completed my undergrad, back in 2008 on a variety of different applications on multiple scales.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I've worked on a few fun rojects along the way.
				Some that blew up in my face, that can only be termed "horribly inefficient". Some that are still running in the real world serving over a billion client requests per hour,
				some that are still considered benchmark applications and some protptypes that were built, tested and approved, but never really put to production.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Now, persuing my Masters in Computer Science from Northeastern University, I'm out on a new journey. New milestones to set, new projects to work on, new technologies to learn and all soo many fun systems to develop!
				They say a journey of a thousand steps starts with one.
				This is my first step and I'm sure my journey, whereever it leads me, would be a fruitful and experience rich one that I can remeniss.
